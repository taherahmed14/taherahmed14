<h1>Hey you, I'm Taher</h1>

### :heavy_minus_sign: Interested on my Story?
 I graduated in Civil Engineering, started my career as a Site Engineer and after a year I joined as a Rebar Detailer and continued to work for the next 3 years. I was not satisfied with my career growth and I started looking for other career opportunities and that was the time the platform of Web development intrigued me.

After exploring career paths on Web development I fortunately came to know about Masai School and joined a 30 weeks full time course on Full-Stack Web Development. And since then I became determined to learn new skills and frameworks and it has always been exciting to apply them on developing my own projects. Started from scratch with no knowledge about Web development and was able to build an E-commerce page with proper page flow and validations in just 2 months ignited the spark in me to learn more, develop more and keep growing.

Masai has developed my skills with hands-on experience on MERN stack, critical thinking by solving Data Structures and Algorithms and also soft skills. My previous work experiences combined with everything I have learnt in the last few months has made me skilled in coordination, clear communication and decision making which I was able to experience while working with a team during our construct week projects.

Looking forward to applying the acquired skills on solving intricate problems and making life much easier. Feel free to reach me at taherahmed.sj.95@gmail.com.
